Process Changelog Module
========================

Changelog module for ProcessWire CMS/CMF.
Copyright (c) 2013-2019 Teppo Koivula

This module keeps track of changes (edits, additions, removals etc.) on your
ProcessWire site. It is not intended as a version control solution: for that
purpose there are other modules. The goal of this module is to provide admin
users with a quick overview of sitewide changes.

## Requirements

The master branch of this module requires ProcessWire 2.3.1+. If you're running
an earlier version of ProcessWire you probably should consider updating it, but
if that's not an option, please check out the legacy branch instead:

https://github.com/teppokoivula/ProcessChangelog/tree/legacy

Automatic cleanup (which is recommended) requires that you install the LazyCron
module. While said modue is bundled with the core package, it is not installed
by default. Without automatic cleanup your database can eventually become slow
as more and more changelog data gets stored in it.

## Installing

This module is installed just like any other ProcessWire module: copy or clone
the directory containing this module to your /site/modules/ directory, log in,
go to Admin > Modules, click "Check for new modules", and install "Changelog".

Process Changelog Hooks will be automatically installed with the main module,
Process Changelog. Installing Process Changelog RSS is completely optional: if
installed, it provides you with a publicly viewable RSS feed of the changes to
your site. More details under heading "Changelog RSS feed".

## How to use

When you install this module, it creates a new page into the Admin called
Changelog (Settings > Changelog). This page contains a list of changes to
pages on the site since the moment this module was installed. By clicking
the *more* link next to each row reveals more information about that
particular change.

In order to access the Changelog page, users need to a) be authenticated and
b) have a role with the "changelog" permission *or* have the superuser role.
While the changelog permission will be added automatically when this module
is installed, it needs to be given to any applicable roles manually.

### Changelog RSS feed

This module provides two types of RSS feeds: one that can be accessed only by
authenticated users via the Changelog page (/setup/changelog/rss/), and other
which can be enabled by installing the optional Process Changelog RSS module,
typing in a key to it's config settings, and accessing the feed via URL such
as this: http://example.com/process-changelog-rss.xml?key=1234567890.

Since the latter feed can be accessed via a public URL, please make sure that
your key is as difficult to guess as possible (and never use key 1234567890).
If you are unsure about whether you really need this feature, please leave
the Process Changelog RSS module uninstalled.

## Settings

This module contains a bunch of settings you should be aware of. Settings can
be defined via ProcessWire's native module configuration screen, and each of
the bundled module's has it's own settings.
